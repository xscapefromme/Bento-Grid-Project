### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size



### Links

- Live Site URL: [(https://bento-grid-project-three.vercel.app/)]

## My process
Very difficult. Going into this didn't know anything about a grid layout and so had a learning curve on just learning on how to make a grid template and align it properly. Still don't think its right because still need to get the responsiveness. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

Learned CSS grid box but still trying to refine that learning curve, learned more deeply about responveness and the properties that are needed to be able to do so for example the clamp value and using it for font-sizes. Learned properties such as grid-column, grid-row, the span value as well as utilziing the max-width for the image element.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
font-size: clamp( 1rem, 5vw, 6rem);
}
```




### Continued development

Still need A LOT of practice for grid placement and the responvness. Did not achive mobile layout and thats something that Im going to come back to to refine.
